I also used pyaudio to record audio as your screen is being recorded.\r\n\r\n##how to get it running\r\nThis should work with any python 3.x version, as long as you have tkinter and pyaudio installed. Tkinter usually comes with the default python installation, and you can install pyaudio through one of the following commands:\r\n```\r\npip install pyaudio\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\npython -m pip install pyaudio\r\n```\r\nadditionally, you need to get ffmpeg.exe from the windows package [here](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/). then just take ffmpeg.exe from the bin folder, and put it in the same folder as the script\r\n",
